**js13k edition can be played here: http://js13kgames.com/entries/puzzleggs** (you can play it here)

## Introduction

**PUZZLEggs Complete Edition** is a post-compo version of my js13k 2019 entry. The theme was "BACK".

-------

## Notes on code

With some tomato sauce it's almost edible.

-------

## Building

Run `./tools/dist.sh`. Closure compiler is included in this repo. One should note that - unlike in the js13k version repo -, this script does not build the project with advanced compiling on, due to the fact that Howler.js does not work well with es6 modules.
